## CPU-Computer Organization and Design

There is single cycle and pipelined CPU.

Single cycle is in `lab-single`.

Pipelined(without hazard resolution) is in `lab-pipeline`.(However, control hazards might be solved.)

Pipelined with hazard is in `lab-ppl-ha`.

Single CPU for **SWORD** is in `cpu622`.

Pipelined with hazard for **SWORD** is in `cpu625`.
